### Hi there!
I'm Alfie, 15 years old and trying to make my life a little bit brighter by using what I love - computers.
************

## About me
Currently learning: TypeScript, C#, Lua, Game Design
Pronouns: he/him, they/them (either are OK!)
Discord: alfie#1234
Email: alfie@toromi.cyou
Note: you have a better chance at reaching me on discord!

## Projects, languages, what I work on
I'm a Developer at [Iteki](https://iteki.pw), a small private server based on cmyui's [gulag](https://github.com/cmyuiosu/gulag) framework.
Aside from that, I mostly do things that I enjoy, such as making discord bots and various tools to make my programming / computer life more efficient.
